    <p><a href="https://alvarezlopezjosem.github.io">Dr. Jose M. Alvarez</a> is a research director at NVIDIA, leading the Autonomous Vehicle Applied Research team. His team maximizes the impact of the latest research advances on the AV product.

Jose completed his Ph.D. in computer science in Barcelona, specializing in road-scene understanding for autonomous driving when datasets were very limited. He also worked as a postdoctoral researcher at NYU under Yann LeCunn.</p>
    <p><strong>9:45 am – 10:30 am: Sergio Casas - <em>Perceiving and Forecasting Anything with Self-Supervision</em></strong></p>
    <p><em>Abstract:</em> Perceiving and forecasting the world are critical tasks for self-driving. Supervised approaches leverage annotated object labels to learn a model of the world -- traditionally with object detections and trajectory predictions, or semantic bird's-eye-view occupancy fields. However, these annotations are expensive and typically limited to a set of predefined categories that do not cover everything we might encounter on the road. Instead, we explore methods to learn to perceive and forecast with self-supervision from LiDAR data. We show that such self-supervised world models can be easily and effectively transferred to downstream tasks.</p>
    <p><a href="https://sergiocasas.github.io/">Dr. Sergio Casas</a> is a Senior Staff Tech Lead Manager at Waabi, where he leads the Perception and Behavior Reasoning team.

    <p><strong>11:00 am – 11:45 am: Boyi Li - <em>Tokenize the World into Object-level Knowledge to Address Long-tail Events in Autonomous Driving</em></strong></p>
    <p><em>Abstract:</em> The autonomous driving industry is increasingly adopting end-to-end learning from sensory inputs to minimize human biases in system design. Traditional end-to-end driving models, however, suffer from long-tail events due to rare or unseen inputs within their training distributions. To address this, we propose TOKEN, a novel Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MM-LLM) that tokenizes the world into object-level knowledge, enabling better utilization of LLM's reasoning capabilities to enhance autonomous vehicle planning in long-tail scenarios. TOKEN effectively alleviates data scarcity and inefficient tokenization by leveraging a traditional end-to-end driving model to produce condensed and semantically enriched representations of the scene, which are optimized for LLM planning compatibility through deliberate representation and reasoning alignment training stages. Our results demonstrate that TOKEN excels in grounding, reasoning, and planning capabilities, outperforming existing frameworks with a 27% reduction in trajectory L2 error and a 39% decrease in collision rates in long-tail scenarios.</p>
    <p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/boyilics">Dr. Boyi Li</a> is a Research Scientist at NVIDIA Research and a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Berkeley, where she is advised by Prof. Jitendra Malik and Prof. Trevor Darrell. She received her Ph.D. from Cornell University, under the guidance of Prof. Serge Belongie and Prof. Kilian Q. Weinberger. Dr. Li’s research focuses on learning from multimodal data, developing generalizable algorithms and interactive intelligent systems, and concentrating on areas such as reasoning, large language models, generative models, and robotics. Her work involves aligning representations from multimodal data, including 2D pixels, 3D geometry, language, and audio. </p>
    <p><strong>11:45 am – 12:30 pm: Fergal Cotter - <em>Building Digital Cities</em></strong></p>
    <p><em>Abstract:</em> We explore the space of neural reconstruction methods for resimulation and its importance for self-driving. At Wayve, we challenge the status quo of self-driving and advocate heavily for an end-to-end “AV2.0” approach, where the driving model connects directly to sensor inputs and control outputs. In the same vein, we advocate for doing resimulation in the wild with the barest of requirements. In this talk, we look at how we’ve put this into practice at Wayve in building our Ghost-Gym resimulation engine on top of PRISM-1.</p>
    <p><a href="https://fergalcotter.com/">Dr. Fergal Cotter</a> is a Staff Applied Scientist at Wayve, where he has mostly looked at the Perception side of End-to-End driving. In particular, he has focused on how perception and geometry information can be distilled into driving models, as well as ensuring a good grasp of what is happening in the training data. Recently, he has explored the resimulation problem and how driving models can be benchmarked without ever taking them on the road. Before joining Wayve, Dr. Cotter completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge, where he worked on using the wavelet and frequency domain as a good representation and learning space for image understanding.</p>
